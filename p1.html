		<strong>Artificial intelligence (AI)</strong>
	</h3><p>
	Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition and machine vision.</p>


<h4 class="section-title">
    <strong>AI programming focuses on three cognitive skills: learning, reasoning and self-correction:</strong>

<h4 class="section-title">
    <strong>Learning processes:</strong>
  </h4><p>This aspect of AI programming focuses on acquiring data and creating rules for how to turn the data into actionable information. The rules, which are called algorithms, provide computing devices with step-by-step instructions for how to complete a specific task.</p>

<h4 class="section-title">
    <strong>Reasoning processes:</strong>
  </h4><p>This aspect of AI programming focuses on choosing the right algorithm to reach a desired outcome.</p>

<h4 class="section-title">
    <strong>Self-correction processes:</strong>
  </h4><p>This aspect of AI programming is designed to continually fine-tune algorithms and ensure they provide the most accurate results possible.</p>

 <strong> Components of AI</strong>
  </h2>
  <p>As the hype around AI has accelerated, vendors have been scrambling to promote how their products and services use AI. Often what they refer to as AI is simply one component of AI, such as machine learning. AI requires a foundation of specialized hardware and software for writing and training machine learning algorithms. No one programming language is synonymous with AI, but a few, including Python, R and Java, are popular.AI is not just one technology.AI as a service (AIaaS) Because hardware, software and staffing costs for AI can be expensive, many vendors are including AI components in their standard offerings or providing access to artificial intelligence as a service (AIaaS) platforms. AIaaS allows individuals and companies to experiment with AI for various business purposes and sample multiple platforms before making a commitment.</p>
